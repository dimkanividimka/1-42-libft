This or similar ways to prevent overflow issues does not really work for all of cases. I asked chatGPT and here is our discussion:
ME:
Hi!
How lines 
[...
if ((nmemb * size) < nmemb || (nmemb * size) < size)
		return (NULL); 
...]
prevent overflow in ft_calloc function below?
#include "libft.h"

void	*ft_calloc(size_t nitems, size_t size)
{
	void	*ptr;

	if (nitems == 0 || size == 0)
	{
		ptr = malloc(0);
		return (ptr);
	}
	if ((nitems * size) < nitems || (nitems * size) < size)
		return (NULL);
	ptr = malloc(nitems * size);
	if (!ptr)
		return (NULL);
	ft_bzero(ptr, nitems * size);
	return (ptr);
}

CHATGPT:
The lines you are referring to are checking for integer overflow in the multiplication of nitems and size.

In the expression (nmemb * size) < nmemb || (nmemb * size) < size), if nmemb * size is greater than or equal to the maximum value that can be stored in a size_t variable, then the multiplication will result in an integer overflow. In such a case, the result of the multiplication will be a value that is smaller than either nitems or size.

For example, if nitems is equal to SIZE_MAX and size is equal to 2, then nitems * size will result in an overflow and the resulting value will be smaller than size.

Therefore, the condition (nmemb * size) < nmemb || (nmemb * size) < size) checks for this overflow condition by comparing the result of the multiplication to both nitems and size. If either of these conditions is true, it means that an overflow has occurred, and the function returns NULL.

By checking for integer overflow, the function is protecting against potential security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to a system or cause it to crash.

but nmemb*size can be also greater than nmemb even after overflow occured, can't it?

CHATGPT:
You're correct that checking (nmemb * size) < nmemb or (nmemb * size) < size may not be enough to catch all possible cases of integer overflow. It's possible that the result of the multiplication could be greater than both nmemb and size even if an overflow has occurred.

However, in practice, if nmemb * size overflows, it's likely that the resulting value will be smaller than either nmemb or size, since size_t is typically a large unsigned integer type. Checking for the overflow condition as (nmemb * size) < nmemb || (nmemb * size) < size is a simple way to catch most cases of overflow and prevent potential vulnerabilities.

To catch all possible cases of integer overflow, one can use more sophisticated techniques such as checking the multiplication result against the maximum value of the size_t type, or using compiler-specific built-in functions for performing overflow checks. However, these approaches may be more complex and less portable than the simple check used in the example code.

okay so how is the original calloc protected from overflowing?

CHATGPT:
The original calloc function implementation in the C standard library does not perform an explicit check for integer overflow in the multiplication of nmemb and size.

Instead, it relies on the fact that integer overflow behavior is well-defined for unsigned integer types in C. Specifically, in an unsigned integer arithmetic operation that overflows, the result is reduced modulo the maximum value representable by the type, which is the same as taking the remainder of the result divided by one more than the maximum value representable by the type.

For example, if size_t is a 32-bit unsigned integer type, and we try to compute UINT32_MAX * 2, which is an overflow, the result will be 0, since UINT32_MAX + 1 equals 0.

Therefore, as long as the nmemb * size multiplication does not overflow to produce an undefined behavior, the calloc function should allocate the correct amount of memory. However, if the multiplication does overflow, the result will be incorrect and may cause the calloc function to allocate insufficient memory or even crash the program.

In summary, while the original calloc function relies on the well-defined behavior of unsigned integer overflow, the ft_calloc function in the example code performs an explicit check for integer overflow to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
